# What is this?

This is a boilerplate WordPress theme functionality plugin I pieced together for my own use based off of
[Chris Coyier and Dave Mozdzanowski's CSS Tricks Functionality plugin](https://github.com/chriscoyier/css-tricks-functionality-plugin).

It includes stuff I use often for most sites I build, and so can be easily reused on different sites.

It will be continually updated as I add and refine components and functionality.

# Can I use it?

Yes :) Let me know if you do anything cool with it.

# What's included?

Everything is separated into different files so as to be modularly enabled/disabled. This is everything:

1. Custom post types
2. Custom taxonomies
3. Remove Admin bar for logged-in admins
4. Clean up the `<head>`
5. Insert `<figure>` tag to uploaded image attachments
6. Detects long urls in comments and marks as spam
7. Remove Jetpack bar
8. Remove unwanted (mostly Jetpack) assets
9. Remove author url from comment posts

# How do I use it?

Perform a search & replace on all files, replacing `kaylamoz` with yoursitename, `KAYLAMOZ` with YOURSITENAME, and `KaylaMoz` with YourSiteName.

# Thanks

Again, to [Chris Coyier](https://css-tricks.com) and [Dave Mozdzanowski](https://github.com/jawittdesigns/)'s excellent and continued work.
